Probabilistic instrumental learning task RL simulation

Simple script to simulate performance on a Probabilistic Instrumental Learning Task
as modelled by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model with reciprocal value update 
(counterfactual update for unchosen option). Illustration that increased asymptotic choice 
accuracy can be attained through manipulations to reward sensitivity, value decay, and choice
stochasticity.
